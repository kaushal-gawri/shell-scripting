* Execute man pages through man <man-page name>.
  Replace <man-page name> with ./first-monitor-manpage or ./second-monitor-manpage or ./kernel_build_manpage
  By this the format will be similar with the man pages in general, or add them directly to /man present in root's directory.

* Remember to change the directories as per requirements in all the scripts
* Report is added in the Markdown format with the graphs also pushed on github
